Run Locally: 
1. Make sure to have Node installed.
2. Run npm install in console
3. Run npm start in console
4. And your're done!

The game was made using an MVC model and jquery/ES6 to render. I am still learning these types of structures and ways to create web pages/games.
I am proud with the output of the project and am extremely excited to continue to learn and improve my coding skills.
